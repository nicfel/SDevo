# SDevo


SDevo is a [BEAST2](http://beast2.org) package that implementes the multi-type birth death process with state dependent rates of evolution. It provides the BEAST2 code for the manuscript **State-dependent evolutionary models reveal modes of solid tumor growth** by Lewinsohn et al. The material for this manuscript can be found [here](https://github.com/blab/spatial-tumor-phylodynamics).

Upon publication, SDevo will become a regular BEAST2 package downloadable through the BEAUti interface.
In the meantime, we provided a compile BEAST2 jar file for SDevo [here](https://github.com/blab/spatial-tumor-phylodynamics/blob/main/SDevo.jar).


SDevo depends on [BDMM-prime](https://github.com/tgvaughan/BDMM-Prime), a re-implementation of the BDMM package for BEAST2.
